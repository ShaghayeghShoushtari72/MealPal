#what the model may show:
  ##High Retention Rate, High LTV, and High Average Order Value:
This scenario would indicate that the customer service team is effective in resolving user issues, leading to a high retention rate.
Users who continue using the service after submitting a ticket have a high average lifetime value, indicating that they contribute significantly to the business.
Additionally, these retained users have a high average order value, suggesting that they are making valuable purchases.
  ##Low Retention Rate, High LTV, and Low Average Order Value:
In this case, even though the retention rate is low, the users who continue using the service have high lifetime values.
However, the average order value is low, indicating that while these users contribute significantly over time, they make smaller individual purchases.
